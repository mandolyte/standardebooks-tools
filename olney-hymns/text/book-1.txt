    <span>But now with my eyes I behold</span>
    <span>Much more than my heart could conceive,</span>

    <span>How happy thy servants must be</span>

    <span>Vouchsafe, Lord, this blessing to me,</span>

    <span>Elijah's example declares,</span>
    <span>Whatever distress may betide,</span>
    <span>The saints may commit all their cares</span>
    <span>To Him who will surely provide:</span>
    <span>When rain long withheld from the earth</span>

    <span>The prophet, secured from the dearth,</span>
    <span>By ravens was constantly fed.</span>

    <span>More likely to rob than to feed</span>
    <span>Were ravens, who live upon prey;</span>
    <span>But when the Lord's people have need,</span>
    <span>His goodness will find out a way.</span>
    <span>This instance to those may be strange</span>

    <span>Nor is it a singular case</span>
    <span>The wonder is often renew'd;</span>
    <span>And many can say to his praise,</span>
    <span>He sends them by ravens their food.</span>
    <span>Thus worldlings, though ravens indeed,</span>

    <span>Compell'd by a Power unseen,</span>
    <span>Administers oft to their wants:</span>
    <span>God teaches them how to find food</span>
    <span>From all the temptations they feel;</span>
    <span>This raven, who thirsts for my blood,</span>

    <span>He ravens and lions can tame,—</span>
    <span>All creatures obey his command;</span>

    <span>For soon we find it is decreed,</span>
    <span>That bitter must to sweet succeed.</span>

    <span>When sin revives and shows its power,</span>
    <span>When Satan threatens to devour,</span>
    <span>When God afflicts, and men revile,</span>
    <span>We draw our steps with pain and toil.</span>

    <span>When thus deserted, tempest-toss'd,</span>
    <span>The sense of former sweetness lost,</span>
    <span>We tremble lest we were deceived</span>
    <span>In thinking that we once believed.</span>

    <span>The Lord first makes the sweetness known,</span>
    <span>To win and fix us for his own;</span>
    <span>And though we now some bitter meet,</span>
    <span>We hope for everlasting sweet.</span>
